# What is IAM?
	- IAM (Identity Access Management) is where you manage your AWS users and their access to AWS accounts and services.
	
	- The common use of IAM is to manage:
		-Users
		-Groups
		-IAM access policies
		-Roles
	(Note- The user created when you created AWS account is called the "root" user)
	
	- By default, the root users has full administrative rights and access to every part of account.
	- By default, any new users you create in the AWS account are created with no access to any AWS services.(except login)
	- for all users(besides the root user), permission must be given that grant access to AWS services.  

# IAM initial configuration:
=============================
	- AWS best practices: When a new AWS account is created. It is "best practice" to complete the tasks listed in IAM under "security status".
	- Those Task include:
	  -------------------
		- Delete your root access keys.
		- Activate MFA on your root Account 
		- Create individual IAM users.
		- User groups to assign permissions.
		- Apply an IAM password policy
   
 -Activate MFA on your root Account
  ---------------------------------
  # What is MFA?
	- MFA is an abbreviation for Multi-Factor Authentication.
	- It is an additional layer of security on your root account that is provided by 3rd party.
	- And it takes the form of a continually-changing. random six-digit code that you will need to input(in addition to your password) when logging into your root account.
    -How do I get the MFA Code?
	1) Virtual MFA Device
		- Smartphone or tablet.
		- Commonly used app(ios & Android): Google Authenticator.
	2) Hardware key Fob
		- Small physical device with display that you can attached to your keychain
		- Order it directly form AWS.

 -Create individual IAM users
  ---------------------------
   1) AWS best practice is to never use your root account for day-to-day use
   2) If you want full admin access for yourself. create an IAM user and attach the "AdministratorAccess" policy to it.
   3) Then use that account to daily driver.

 -User groups to assign permissions
  ---------------------------------
    - It can often be more convenient and efficient to setup groups and assign permissions to the group rather than manage each user individually. 


 -Apply an IAM password policy
  ----------------------------
	- A password policy dictates the format and expiration rules that must be followed when a user create or modifies their password.
	- These rules include password:
		1)Length --minimum 6 digit password applicable
		2)Case requirments.
		3)Number requirments
		4)Non-alphanumeric requirments
		5)Password expiration. ---define days how many days you want to keep password
		6)Password reuse --define how many times you want to reuse the same password.
		7)User rights to change their own password
		8)Administrator reset requirments

# IAM Users and Policies
=========================
  - We have aws account and also we have IAM account and IAM users, so this users want to access some specific services then we define some specific access to this users using policies.
    (Example. We have one IAM user and he wants to access of s3 we are assigning only s3 policis to this users using attach policy) 
	Note - At the time of IAM user creation you are assigning autogenerated password to particular user then he is not able to login account


# IAM Groups and Policies
==========================
  - If we want to remove policy from user then go to user, clik on detach policy
  - If many users are using same service then create one group for all users and assign specific policy to that group.
  - Go to Groups-->Add Users-->Attach Policy.

# IAM Roles
===========
   - We have ec2 instance there is two three different service running, So one AWS service trying to communicate another AWS service.
   - lets just think we want to assign any policy to AWS services we cant assign direct policy to any AWS services, First we need to attach ROLE, then this IAM ROLE attach to policy, IAM ROLE give  	       permisson to AWS service to access policies.
    - clik to role-->create role-->assign policy--name to role.  


---------------------------------------------------  

*** Question **
===============
Que.1) Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is an important part of account security that should be set on your "root" account.
	==> True. (MFA is part of AWS's best practices for IAM account security)

Que.2) IAM polices can be directly attached to each of the following EXCEPT:
	==> EC2 Instance. (IAM policies can be directly attached to IAM roles, users and groups. 
				IAM policies can only be applied to other AWS services (indirectly) through IAM roles.)

Que.3) If a user has access to S3 through a group with an S3 policy attached, what happens if that user is removed from the group?
	==> The user no longer has access to s3.

Que.4) IAM is where you manage your AWS users and their access to AWS features and services?
	==> True.

Que.5) If you want to grant S3 access to an EC2 instance, what should you do?
	==> Create an EC2 Role and attach an s3 access policy to it. 
		(You can only assign permissions another AWS service through IAM roles (with a policy attached to the role))
