 ======= Development and Deployment Workflow ========

Step 1.
------
User Story (Means:Requirment document, what n How to build the project, Which teams are involved, decide Time for build application)
	  
Step 2.
------
Sprint Planning (Using JIRA or any other tool) Task designing for required team and others fellow team member.

Step 3.
------
 3A. -If the project is new THEN create new repository in GIT, after in new repo there is MASTER_BRANCH, 
     -in MASTER_BRANCH define project working structure nd push this project in MASTER_BRANCH. 
 			   ---- 
 3B. -After committing project architecture in MASTER_BRANCH, create one DEV_BRANCH from MASTER_BRANCH.
  
 3C. -After DEV_BRANCH create some FEATURE_BRANCHS(1,2,3,...etc.) from DEV_BRANCH regarding tasks nd requirment. In this branch developer doing all work regarding project and push into this branch.
  

Step 4.
------
-Then create one main FEATURE_BRANCH and merge all FEATURE_BRANCHES into one FEATURE_BRANCH.
-Then deploying FEATURE_BRANCH on Dev_Environment nd testing team test FEATURE_BRANCH on Dev_Environment(its office local environment), 
-if everything will be fine on Dev_Environment, then testing team giving signoff to FEATURE_BRANCH.

Step 5. 
------
-After signoff to FEATURE_BRANCH, FEATURE_BRANCH merge into DEV_BRANCH, now DEV_BRANCH deploying on UAT_Environment,
-if everything will be fine on UAT_Environment, then testing team giving signoff to DEV_BRANCH.

Step 6.
------
-After signoff to DEV_BRANCH, create RELEASE_BRANCH from DEV_BRANCH, then RELEASE_BRANCH deploying on Pre-Production_Environment,
-testing team doing some test on Pre-Production_Environment, 
-if everything will be fine on Pre-Production_Environment, then testing team giving signoff to RELEASE_BRANCH.

Step 7.
------
Now This RELEASE_BRANCH deploying to Production_Environment and then RELEASE_BRANCH merge into master branch.
